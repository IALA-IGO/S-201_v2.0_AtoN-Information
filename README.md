# S-201_v2.0_AtoN-Information

At ARM-21 WG2 Reported the following:

The input submitted by the China MSA was reviewed, and the need to revise or extend certain elements from the perspective of the S-201 data model was discussed.
The group emphasized the necessity of establishing a platform to track discussions related to the S-201 standard. 
Accordingly, the IALA Secretariat was requested to secure storage space for the S-201 standard within the GitHub platform currently being prepared by IALA.

Once the S-201 GitHub under IALA’s management becomes available, it was agreed that records of discussions concerning proposed revisions to the S-201 standard would be maintained there to ensure traceability. 
Furthermore, it was decided that when such revisions are incorporated, the updated version of the standard will be issued as S-201 Edition 2.1.0.
Furthermore, it was suggested that IALA should use the IHO change proposal form to manage and track changes to the operational version.
S-201 Edition 2.1.0 will be harmonized with S-125 1.0.0. In the future S-201 edition 2.1.0 will be published inline with the IHO publication timeline for S-125. 

Action item:
The Secretariat is requested to setup a GitHub repository to track issues and changes for S-201.
